# My Dotfiles for the Neovim text editor.
I use these dots on every machine I have.
The startup time for neovim is bad, as it checks for changes in this repo on every startup.
This is intentional and will not be changed.
Remove the first two lines of init.lua if you wish to remove the feature.
Can be git cloned directly into .config, or into a higher neovim dir if you wish to stow it.
